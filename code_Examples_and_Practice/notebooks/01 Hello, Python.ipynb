    "Welcome to Kaggle Learn's Python course. This course will cover the fundamental Python skills that you’ll need before jumping in to using Python for data science. These lessons are aimed at those with some previous coding experience who are looking to add Python to their repertoire or level up their Python skills.

You may want to check out [these \"Python for Non-Programmers\" learning resources](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).)\n",
